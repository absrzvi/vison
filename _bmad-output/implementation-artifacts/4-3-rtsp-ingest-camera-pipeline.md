# Story 4.3: rtsp-ingest Camera Pipeline

Status: review

## Story

As a system operator,
I want the `rtsp-ingest` container to connect to 25–30 RTSP camera streams, enforce P1/P2/P3 priority frame rates, and activate P3 exterior cameras only during station windows,
so that the Hailo-8 TOPS budget is managed correctly and downstream inference always receives frames at the right priority.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Camera config load + health gate:** Given `cameras.json` at repo root defines 25–30 cameras with fields `{ rtsp_url, camera_id, coach_id, zone, priority }`, when `rtsp-ingest` starts, it loads `cameras.json`, initialises a `hailo-apps` `multisource` GStreamer pipeline for all entries, and connects to each stream; `GET /health/ready` returns HTTP 200 only when at least one P1 stream is active.

2. **Priority frame rates enforced:** Given the pipeline is running, when frames are being processed, P1 cameras (door/vestibule) deliver at 10 fps always; P2 cameras (interior) deliver at 5 fps always; P3 cameras (exterior/platform) deliver at 8 fps only during the station window — at all other times P3 cameras are gated off.

3. **TOPS budget throttle:** Given `scheduler.py` monitors the TOPS budget, when the budget exceeds the configured threshold (default: 90% of 26 TOPS), P2 cameras are throttled to 2 fps; a structured log is emitted at WARNING: `budget_pressure`, `tops_used_pct`, `throttled_tier="P2"`, `recoverable=True`; P1 cameras are never throttled.

4. **P3 station window gate:** Given `gate.py` receives a context state update from `vlan-pollers` with `next_station` and `speed_kmh < 20`, when the station window condition is met (speed below threshold AND door release signal received), P3 cameras are activated within 500ms; when `speed_kmh > 20` again P3 cameras are deactivated.

5. **RTSP disconnect + reconnect:** Given a P1 camera stream drops (RTSP disconnect), when the disconnect is detected by the GStreamer pipeline, a `CAMERA_DEGRADED` event is POSTed to `event-store` with `camera_id`, `coach_id`, `reason`; reconnect is attempted with `DEFAULT_RETRY` exponential backoff; on reconnect a `CAMERA_RECOVERED` event is posted.

6. **Door-release P1 override (internal):** Given `rtsp-ingest` exposes `POST /context` and receives a `door_release` push from `vlan-pollers`, when the push payload includes `{ event: "door_release", car_id, door_id }`, `gate.py` looks up the `camera_ids` associated with that `door_id` in `cameras.json`, raises their priority to P1 for 120 seconds, and emits a `STREAM_PRIORITY` internal command; this command is NOT written to `event-store` and NOT published via MQTT — it is internal to `rtsp-ingest` only (ADR-18 Trigger 1); after the 120-second window the cameras revert to their configured priority.

7. **Quality gates:** `tests/unit/test_scheduler.py` covers P2 throttle trigger and recovery conditions with synthetic TOPS readings; `tests/unit/test_gate.py` covers P3 activation/deactivation with synthetic speed + door state inputs, and door-release P1 override with a 120-second timeout; `mypy --strict src/` passes; `pytest --strict-markers` achieves ≥90% coverage of `src/rtsp_ingest/` excluding `pipeline.py` (hardware-dependent; marked `integration`).

## Security Tests

**OEBB-specific:**
- [ ] `test_no_env_get_in_scheduler` — `scheduler.py` must not call `os.environ.get()` (Rule 8)
- [ ] `test_no_env_get_in_gate` — `gate.py` must not call `os.environ.get()` (Rule 8)
- [ ] `test_no_env_get_in_config` — `config.py` config loading must not call `os.environ.get()` directly in business logic (Rule 8)
- [ ] `test_no_env_get_in_pipeline` — `pipeline.py` must not call `os.environ.get()` (Rule 8)
- [ ] `test_stream_priority_not_posted_to_event_store` — door_release flow must emit zero HTTP POSTs to event-store with `STREAM_PRIORITY` type (ADR-18)
- [ ] `test_stream_priority_not_logged_as_event` — `STREAM_PRIORITY` must not appear in any event-store POST body
- [ ] `test_context_post_malformed_payload_returns_422` — `POST /context` with invalid JSON returns 422 with no internal detail
- [ ] No raw RTSP credentials appear in structured log output (rtsp_url redacted in logs)

## Dev Notes

### Critical Architecture Rules (Must Not Break)

1. **Rule 8 — No `os.environ.get()`** anywhere in business logic. All config comes from `pydantic-settings` `Settings` class injected via constructor. Enforced by AST security tests (same pattern as E4-S1, E4-S2).

2. **ADR-18 Trigger 1 — `STREAM_PRIORITY` is internal only.** When `gate.py` handles a `door_release` event and promotes cameras to P1, the resulting `STREAM_PRIORITY` command MUST NOT be:
   - POSTed to `event-store`
   - Published via MQTT
   - Written anywhere outside `rtsp-ingest` process memory
   This is a hard architecture boundary. The security test `test_stream_priority_not_posted_to_event_store` enforces it.

3. **P1 cameras are never throttled.** `scheduler.report_tops()` may only reduce P2 fps. P1 fps is always `settings.p1_fps`. Enforced by `test_p1_never_throttled`.

4. **`pipeline.py` is hardware-dependent — skip in unit coverage.** All GStreamer/HailoRT code lives in `pipeline.py`. Unit tests only cover `on_stream_degraded` / `on_stream_recovered` with mocked httpx. Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration` and exclude from standard `pytest` run.

5. **Dependency injection everywhere.** `Pipeline`, `Scheduler`, `Gate` all receive dependencies via constructor — no internal instantiation of adapters or HTTP clients. Same pattern as `vlan-pollers` E4-S2.

6. **`DEFAULT_RETRY` from `oebb_shared.http.retry`** — apply on `on_stream_degraded` reconnect helper only (not on the run loop itself; the loop must survive retry exhaustion).

7. **`asyncio_mode = "auto"` in `pyproject.toml`** — no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` needed on any test. Use `@pytest.mark.anyio` for async tests (same as vlan-pollers). Blind exception `pytest.raises(Exception)` is forbidden (ruff B017) — always use specific types.

### Key Design Decisions

**P3 gate timing (AC 4):** `gate.py` must activate P3 within 500ms of receiving the context update. This is a synchronous call chain — `on_context_update → scheduler.gate_p3(True)`. No async sleep between. The `test_p3_activation_within_500ms` test times this with `time.perf_counter()`.

**Door-release lookup:** `cameras.json` maps `door_id` to cameras via the `zone` field or a `door_ids` list. The story epics show `gate.py` "looks up the `camera_ids` associated with that `door_id` in `cameras.json`". Implement by filtering `cameras` list for entries whose `zone` includes the door or by a direct `door_id → [camera_id]` map in the JSON schema. Choose the simpler approach — a top-level `"door_camera_map": { "door-1A": ["C1_EXT_01"] }` dict in `cameras.json`.

**`cameras.json` schema:** Place at repo root (per architecture spec). Dev agent must create this file with at least 3 cameras (1 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) and a `door_camera_map`. Schema:
```json
{
  "cameras": [
    {
      "camera_id": "C1_DOOR_01",
      "coach_id": "car-1",
      "rtsp_url": "rtsp://cam-host:554/stream/C1_DOOR_01",
      "zone": "door",
      "priority": "P1"
    }
  ],
  "door_camera_map": {
    "door-1A": ["C1_DOOR_01"]
  }
}
```

**Structured log fields (mandatory):** Every `log.warning(...)` call must include at minimum one ID field (`camera_id`, `coach_id`, or `event_id`) plus a descriptive keyword. Pattern from E4-S2: `log.warning("camera_degraded", camera_id="C3_INT", recoverable=True)`.

**RTSP credential security:** `rtsp_url` in `cameras.json` may include credentials (e.g. `rtsp://user:pass@host/stream`). Never log the full URL — log only `camera_id`. Enforce in `on_stream_degraded`.

### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | pydantic-settings; TOPS thresholds, fps values, URL config |
| `models.py` | `CameraConfig`, `CameraState`, `Priority` enum; `load_cameras()` |
| `scheduler.py` | TOPS budget enforcement; per-camera fps state; P2 throttle; P3 gate; override window |
| `gate.py` | Context update dispatch; P3 station window logic; door-release P1 override; STREAM_PRIORITY (internal) |
| `health.py` | FastAPI routes: `/health/ready`, `/health/live`, `POST /context` |
| `pipeline.py` | GStreamer multisource wrapper; CAMERA_DEGRADED / CAMERA_RECOVERED event posting; reconnect retry |
| `main.py` | Entry point; wires all components; starts uvicorn |

### Learnings from E4-S2 (vlan-pollers)

- **AST security tests** are written exactly as in `test_apc_poller.py` — `ast.walk(tree)` checking for `os.environ.get()` attribute calls. Copy pattern verbatim.
- **`frozenset` / `tuple` for injected collections** — immutable to prevent accidental mutation during polling. Apply to `car_ids` lists → `tuple`; to `camera_id` sets → `frozenset`.
- **`dataclasses.asdict()`** for full equality comparison of state objects — use in `gate.py` if comparing context payloads.
- **Ruff B017** — never `pytest.raises(Exception)` — always use specific exception type.
- **Ruff F841** — don't bind `as mock_log` in `with patch(...)` unless you assert on `mock_log`.
- **`DEFAULT_RETRY`** applied to single fetch helpers, never to the run loop.
- **`httpx.AsyncClient` at instance level** — created in `__init__`, closed in `aclose()`. Module-level clients caused issues in tests.
- **`anyio` for async tests** — `@pytest.mark.anyio` + `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml.
- **`respx.mock`** for httpx transport-level mocking — use for event-store POST tests.

### Test Strategy

- `pipeline.py` is excluded from unit coverage — mark with `# pragma: no cover` on GStreamer-dependent lines, or use `--ignore=src/rtsp_ingest/pipeline.py` in coverage config.
- All tests in `tests/unit/` — no integration tests run in CI.
- Use `AsyncMock` for `scheduler` in gate tests, `scheduler` in health tests.
- Use `respx.mock` + `httpx` for event-store POST assertions in pipeline event tests.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-6

### Debug Log References

- structlog `event=` kwarg collision in gate.py — renamed to `command=` (structlog reserves `event` as the positional log message)
- ruff UP042 — migrated `Priority(str, Enum)` to `Priority(StrEnum)` (Python 3.11+)
- main.py lifespan wired via `app.router.lifespan_context` — FastAPI `build_app` factory pattern used so health tests get clean app instances without module-level state

### Completion Notes List

All 7 task groups complete. Package scaffolded from scratch following E4-S2 patterns exactly. Security tests written first (RED), then implementation (GREEN). 41 unit tests pass at 100% coverage (pipeline.py excluded per config). mypy --strict clean on 8 source files. ruff clean. `cameras.json` created at repo root with 3 cameras (P1/P2/P3) and `door_camera_map`. `docker-compose.dev.yml` updated with `rtsp-ingest` service. STREAM_PRIORITY is internal-only — enforced by both AST security tests and gate.py having no httpx import. P1 fps never throttled — enforced by test and implementation. `door_camera_map` injected into Gate constructor from cameras.json top-level key.
